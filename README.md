# leap-ds-control
## Overview

`leap-ds-control` is a project that leverages a dynamical systems approach to achieve multifinger object grasping using the open-source Leap Motion hand tracking device. This project aims to provide a robust and flexible framework for controlling robotic hands or virtual hands in a simulated environment.

## Features

- **Dynamical Systems Approach**: Utilizes mathematical models to control the motion and coordination of multiple fingers.
- **Leap Motion Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Leap Motion device for real-time hand tracking and control.
- **Multifinger Grasping**: Supports complex grasping tasks involving multiple fingers, enhancing the dexterity and precision of robotic hands.
- **Open Source**: The project is open-source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Connect your Leap Motion device to your computer.
2. Run the main control script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform multifinger grasping tasks.
